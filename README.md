## The Problem with Traditional Lighting Consoles
- Consoles are **large, heavy, and fixed** in one place.  
- Operators must constantly **walk back and forth** to make adjustments.  
- Transporting and setting up consoles adds **high cost and time delays**.  
- Creativity is limited because control is tied to one physical location.

✅ **Wireless Freedom** – control lights from anywhere in the venue.  
✅ **No Console Required** – Vision Pro becomes the lighting desk.  
✅ **Real-Time Adjustments** – make changes instantly during rehearsals or live shows.
